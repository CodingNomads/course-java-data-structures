#Data Structures
1. **Stack.java** is an implementation of a [generic stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)). 
which is a special list that utilizes a Last-In-First-Out methodology.
1. **Queue.java** is an implementation of a [generic queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)). 
which is a special list that utilizes a First-In-First-Out methodology.
1. **ArrayList.java** is an implementation of generic array linked lists.
1. **LinkedList.java** is an implementation of generic single linked lists, with each node only references the next node.
 This can be used for collisions in the Hash Map implementation.
1. **HashMap.java** is an implementation of a [generic hash map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table).
 Consists in a collection of key value that given a key returns its value.
1. **BinarySearchTree.java** is an integer implementation of a sorted, self-balancing [Binary Search Tree (BST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree). 
A binary tree starts from a root node, and has references to left and right child nodes.
 Left node has always lower value than right node. [tutorial](https://www.baeldung.com/java-binary-tree)
