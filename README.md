#Data Structures
1. **Stack.java** is an implementation of a [generic stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)), which is a special list that utilizes a Last-In-First-Out methodology.
1. **Queue.java** is an implementation of a [generic queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)). which is a special list that utilizes a First-In-First-Out methodology.
1. **SingleLinkedList.java** is an implementation of generic single linked lists, with each node only references the next node. This is used for collisions in the Hash Map implementation (see [Hashmaps](https://github.com/kevgraham/java_algorithms#hash-maps)).
1. **DoubleLinkedList.java** is an implementation of generic double linked lists. This furthers the functionality of a single linked list by implementing a reference to the previous node in addition to the next node.
1. **HashMap.java** is an implementation for a generic hashmap that uses an internal array, a simple *hash method* based on the first character of the key and a **Single Linked List** (see [Lists](https://github.com/kevgraham/java_algorithms#lists)) for collisions. A private inner class called *Pair* is used to store two pieces of data within a linked list node. You can test by running *HashMapTester.java*.
1. **BinarySearchTree.java** is an integer implementation of a sorted, self-balancing [Binary Search Tree (BST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree). A binary tree starts from a root node, and has references to left and right child nodes. A BST is a binary tree that requires the right child node to be greater than the left. You can test by running *BinaryTreeTester.java*.
1. **Trie.java** is a case-insensitive implementation of a [Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie). Each node of the trie has an array of children representing the chars A-Z and the apostrophe char. A String is represented in the Trie with each char being a node, and the final char/node has a boolean isWord set to true to indicate this position in the tree is a valid word.
